## TODO

- [ ] Dungeon tool -> loadable maps

## Design goals

- Keep Bevy-dependent and Bevy-independent code separate when possible
  - Plugins should wrap Bevy-indpendent code
  - This a guideline, not a strict rule, and applies only to major subsystems
- Eventually, more as much code as possible to plugins (mods)

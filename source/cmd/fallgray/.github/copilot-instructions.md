# Copilot Instructions

## Important notes

- The in-game coordinate system uses Z+ as the world up axis (this is NOT the Bevy default, which uses Y+ as up)

## Guidelines

- Sprites SHOULD BE rendered WITH lighting
- Helper functions should be defined at the bottom of the file after all public functions in the same file

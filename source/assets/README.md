# assets

## Design

#### Uses a "pull" based design

In other words, rather than content folders containing the scripts to export their content into game-ready format, the assets folder contains the scripts to import that content. This choice was made for several reasons:

- It keeps content folder free of anything but the source files for the content itself
- It encourages uniformity and normalization in the final format

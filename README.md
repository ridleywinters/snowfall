A long-term, hobby project to create a Daggerfall-like game set in a fictional world based on entirely openly licensed content.

The project is being written in Rust with Deno / TypeScript being used for scripting.  It is using its own engine primarily for the learning experience.  As a hobby project, architecturally it is designed to prefer simplicity, modularity, and code maintainability over maximal runtime efficiency or functionality.

Contributions are very welcome!
